Description:
    This R package contains the data used to test hypotheses about
    the role of iteration as a strategy in problem solving competitions.
    The primary source of data for the analysis is meta data on
    Kaggle competitions. This research project asks the question,
    How effective is iteration as a problem solving strategy, the
    goal of which is to submit multiple solutions with the goal of
    improving solution success each time, as compared to other
    predictors of team success, such as length of time spent on the
    problem and number of teammates contributing to the solution?
